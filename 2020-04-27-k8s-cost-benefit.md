It's hard to tell if Kubernetes is helping me or hurting me.

Helpful?
* don't have to login to multiple servers to get logs, check config, etc.
** seriously, centralized log access is huge. `k logs podname` ftw. 
* i've literally seen services restart and come back up. that's a hell of a lot better than writing scripts everywhere and deploying them by hand.


Annoying
* pod names. hashes. yuck.
