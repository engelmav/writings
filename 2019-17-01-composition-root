# Composition Root

I've been obsessed with the idea of composition roots. Not sure what turned me on to them originally. 
It may have been the DependencyRegistration.cs file in a dotnetcore project.

Anyway, in my current distaste for reflection and code-magic in general, I've been interested in how dependency
injection is helpful and how it's accomplished, how it *really* helps testing etc.

Most recently I saw this kind of design in a Python project. And there is no method of "composition" or "dependency injection." Humble genius.

It's in the rasa core project, specifically in the several modules like [this one](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_core/blob/master/rasa_core/run.py).
