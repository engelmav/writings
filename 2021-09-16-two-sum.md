```
nums list: [2,7,11,15]
target sum: 9
```

so, how many ways do I need to compare the list to itself?
well, each sum will involve two numbers, and they'd have to be unique pairs.
otherwise, i'd be summing numbers that were already summed together.

so, for `[2, 7, 11, 15]`, let's write out their unique pairs.

```
(2, 7),
(2, 11),
(2, 15),
(7, 11),
(7, 15),
(11, 15)
```

did I get them all without repeating? I think so. If I went backward and had compared 7 to 2, or 11 to 2, I'd be repeating the pairs I already had (2, 7) and (2, 11). The order of the pairs is not important.

ok, so how do I do this in a program?

well, we access the items in a list using their index. this list here is called `nums` in the test case, so,
to get the first pair `(2, 7)` we would do `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`. To get the second pair, 
we would do `nums[0]` and `nums[2]`. Let's list these out, and show all of our pairs in the way they are index:

```
(2, 7)   nums[0] and nums[1]
(2, 11)  nums[0] and nums[2]
(2, 15)  nums[0] and nums[3]
```

Do you see the pattern yet? It looks like the second index starts one higher than the first index, and from there, increases by one each time.

```
(7, 11)  
(7, 15)
```

For the pairs above, we got to the end of the list comparing 2 to everything, so then we start
to compare the next number, 7, to everything *after* the number itself (7)

```
(11, 15)
```

For this last pair above, we got to the end of the list comparing 7 to everything, so then we start
to compare the next number, 11, to everything _after_ the number itself (11) - in this case there was only one pair left.


So this is another pattern. If we could summarize this pattern, how would we write it out?

When we move on to the next number in the list, we make pairs only with numbers *after* that number.

```
(current_number_index, current_number_index + 1)
(current_number_index, current_number_index + 2)
(current_number_index, current_number_index + 3)
```

... until the end of the list (`list_size`).

Let's just give that `+1`, `+2` etc. a name -- we'll call it `next_number_increment`.

So, two things are changing, the `current_number_index`, and the `current_number_index + next_number_increment`

first_number_index = 0
last_index = len(nums)

Get the first index (0). Then get every index after that until the end.
For each of every index after, make a pair with the first_index.

At the end of each list, increment the first_index, and then increment the first_index by 1 again, until the end.

```
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]

list_of_pairs = []
last_index = len(nums)
first_number_index = 0

while first_number_index < last_index:  # keep going until the end of the list

    first_number = nums[first_number_index]

    second_number_index = first_number_index + 1

    first_number_index += 1  # the next time around, we'll start with the next first_number_index

    while second_number_index < last_index:  # keep going until the end of the list
        second_number = nums[second_number_index]
        list_of_pairs.append([first_number, second_number])
        second_number_index += 1
```
